# Web Crawler with Keyword Count Tracking

This project is a web crawler that collects titles from a given website, counts the words in each title, tracks the cumulative total of all the words from the titles, and visualizes the crawl data in plots.

- Crawls a website and collects page titles.
- Counts the number of words in each title.
- Tracks the cumulative total of all words encountered in the titles.
- Plots:
  - Crawl Speed (Total Time vs. Number of URLs Crawled).
  - Cumulative Keyword Count vs Crawl Time.
- Exports the crawled data to an Excel file (`web_archive.xlsx`).

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
